# ThinkerFlake promo material: A Thinking Space for Complex Projects, Teams, and Self-Organizers

> “Clear thought precedes powerful action.” - ChatGPT

A reasoning-first environment for self or team organizing and making complex decisions. Capture knowledge, model complex problems, and extract solution workflows, all driven by an informal note keeping system and a formal reasoning engine. Turn your informal notes into formal problem setups. Because the solution workflow is derived from formal reasoning, each decision can be easily explained. Thinkerflake unifies notes, logic, and actions, keeping all your project’s intellectual and operational material in one environment.

## The Process

Idea to execution, in 3 steps (`Knowledge -> Logic -> Action`):

1. **Capture Knowledge:** Collect notes, source materials, and technical data for your project or problem. Keep informal notes within a unique branching mind map.
2. **Model the Problem:** Use formal reasoning structures to map out goals, constraints, and dependencies. Formally model decisions and plans with structured logic, not intuition alone.
3. **Deduce the Workflow:** Deduce a clear, actionable solution workflow directly from your reasoning model. Automatically generate tasks and sequences based on your logical problem setup.

## Who It’s For

Thinkerflake may be used in various cases to help with note keeping and decision making processes, especially for:

- Systems thinkers solving technical problems
- Team leads managing employee workflow coordination
- Knowledge ops leads managing decision-heavy projects

## Example Use Cases

We choose to enumerate three representative use examples.

### 1. Architect a Modular Software System

- **Capture Knowledge:** gather system requirements, API specs, and tech constraints.
- **Model the Problem:** logically connect module dependencies, risk areas, and interface protocols.
- **Deduce the Workflow:** auto-generate a development plan and testing milestones derived from your reasoning tree.

### 2. Coordinate a Complex, Multi-Phase Team Project

- **Capture Knowledge:** gather tasks, deadlines, team capacity, constraints, and notes on risks or clients.
- **Model the Problem:** map task dependencies, bottlenecks, and align work with skills and schedules.
- **Deduce the Workflow:** auto-generate a phased plan with priorities, conflicts, and decision points.

### 3. Decide Between Competing Product Ideas

- **Capture Knowledge:** list market data, feature ideas, and constraints.
- **Model the Problem:** reason through feasibility, market need, and risk tradeoffs.
- **Deduce the Workflow:** generate a roadmap for the selected concept and a revisit plan for the others.

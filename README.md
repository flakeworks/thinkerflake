## A Thinking Space for Power Users Organizing Themselves or a Team
 
Thinkerflake guides you through a structured, reasoning-driven process to turn ideas into actionable outcomes. It begins by capturing all relevant knowledge — notes, data, and references — organized in a branching mind map. From there, you formally model the problem, defining goals, constraints, and dependencies using logical structures. This reasoning foundation allows you to derive a precise, step-by-step solution workflow, automatically translating logic into actionable tasks. Finally, after executing the solution, you reflect on the outcome by producing informal feedback notes — preserving insights, lessons, and context for future projects. This cycle ensures that every decision is reasoned, every action is intentional, and every experience adds to a growing body of usable knowledge.

## The Process

`Knowledge -> Problem -> Solution -> Feedback`:

1. **Capture Knowledge:** Collect notes, source materials, and technical data for a project or problem. Keep informal notes within a unique branching mind map.
2. **Model the Problem:** Use formal reasoning structures to map out goals, constraints, and dependencies. Formally model decisions and plans with structured logic, not intuition alone.
3. **Derive a Solution:** Deduce a clear, actionable solution workflow directly from the reasoning model. Automatically generate tasks and sequences based on the logical problem setup.
4. **Produce Feedback:** Create informal notes describing the solution to the problem. Keep the solution notes for the future reference.

## Who It’s For

Thinkerflake is meant to be used by power users to help with note keeping and decision making processes, especially for:

- Systems thinkers solving technical problems
- Team leads managing employee workflow coordination
- Knowledge ops leads managing decision-heavy projects

## Example Use Cases

We choose to enumerate three representative use examples.

### 1. Architect a Modular Software System

- **Capture Knowledge:** gather system requirements, API specs, and tech constraints.
- **Model the Problem:** logically connect module dependencies, risk areas, and interface protocols.
- **Derive a Solution:** auto-generate a development plan and testing milestones derived from the reasoning tree.
- **Produce Feedback:** record notes on implementation outcomes, challenges faced, and lessons for future builds.

### 2. Coordinate a Complex, Multi-Phase Team Project

- **Capture Knowledge:** gather tasks, deadlines, team capacity, constraints, and notes on risks or clients.
- **Model the Problem:** map task dependencies, bottlenecks, and align work with skills and schedules.
- **Derive a Solution:** auto-generate a phased plan with priorities, conflicts, and decision points.
- **Produce Feedback:** document project outcomes, workflow issues, and team insights for future improvements.

### 3. Decide Between Competing Product Ideas

- **Capture Knowledge:** list market data, feature ideas, and constraints.
- **Model the Problem:** reason through feasibility, market need, and risk tradeoffs.
- **Derive a Solution:** generate a roadmap for the selected concept and a revisit plan for the others.
- **Produce Feedback:** note market reactions, performance data, and decision hindsight for future product cycles.

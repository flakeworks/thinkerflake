# ThinkerFlake: Plan Smarter Projects, with Logic and Clarity

A reasoning-first environment for technical creatives and researchers. Capture knowledge, model complex problems, and extract solution workflows — all driven by an informal note keeping system and a formal reasoning engine.

> ChatGPT: “Clear thought precedes powerful action.”

## The Process

Idea to execution, in 3 steps (`Knowledge -> Logic -> Action`):

1. **Capture Knowledge:** Collect notes, source materials, and technical data for your project or problem.
2. **Model the Problem:** Use formal reasoning structures to map out goals, constraints, and dependencies.
3. **Deduce the Workflow:** Deduce a clear, actionable workflow directly from your reasoning model.

## What Makes It Different

Unlike task managers or note apps, this tool is built on a custom GOFAI-inspired reasoning engine, and:

- **Visually relates your notes:** Keep informal notes within unique branching mind map.
- **Thinks with you:** Formally model decisions and plans with structured logic, not intuition alone.
- **Derives workflows from reasoning:** Automatically generate tasks and sequences based on your logical problem setup.
- **Unifies notes, logic, and actions:** Keep all your project’s intellectual and operational material in one reasoning-first environment.

## Who It’s For

- AI researchers designing alignment models
- Software architects planning complex systems
- Indie toolmakers structuring product roadmaps
- Knowledge ops leads managing decision-heavy projects
- Systems thinkers solving technical problems

## Example “Idea to Realization” Use Cases

### 1. Plan a New AI Alignment Research Paper

- **Capture Knowledge:** collect notes from papers, lectures, and articles.
- **Model the Problem:** map key hypotheses, ethical tradeoffs, and logical constraints.
- **Deduce the Workflow:** generate a writing, peer review, and publishing workflow deduced from the reasoning chain.

### 2. Decide Between Competing Product Ideas

- **Capture Knowledge:** list market data, feature ideas, and constraints.
- **Model the Problem:** reason through feasibility, market need, and risk tradeoffs.
- **Deduce the Workflow:** generate a roadmap for the selected concept and a revisit plan for the others.

### 3. Architect a Modular Software System

- **Capture Knowledge:** gather system requirements, API specs, and tech constraints.
- **Model the Problem:** logically connect module dependencies, risk areas, and interface protocols.
- **Deduce the Workflow:** auto-generate a development plan and testing milestones derived from your reasoning tree.
